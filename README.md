About this project

This was a project perscribed by our course instructors and taken from our learning module system. it was to display what we had learned in this stream and to show usage of d3.js, dc.js and mongodb as well as show our first attempt at deploying to heroku and making it talk with Mongods and mlab

Functionality

this project calls details from the mongodb donations file and displays them in reactive graphs which can be manipulated by state, type of donation, date/time etc. it was very challenging and fustrating at times to get all these working


Issues/Obstacles

this project i found very challenging with all the external elements and having them talk to each other, my biggest issues were with deploying to mlabs and also deployment to Heroku, i found the making of the flask app and putting in the information relatively ok but manipulating it was very fustrating and challenging in the extreme with issues ranging from the initial deployment of mongodb configuring it and then deploying it
